This project is Matlab implementation of Edmonds-Karp and Busacker-Gowen algorithms to find maximum flow at minimum cost in networks.

By checking "PrzykladZastosowaniaMetodySuperujsciaSuperZrodla" script and running consecutive lines with comments you can see the idea of supersources, superoutlets in practice.
By checking "PrzykladEdmondsaKarpa_i_Busackera_Gowena" script and running consecutive lines containing comments you can see the idea of both routing protocols.
Both mentioned scripts include sample parameters of the network. Final result is visible in final script "OptymalizacjaDuzejSieciMetodaSuperzrodelSuperujsc". You can run it, enter sample values and see the effect.

Comments are only in Polish for now, but they will be changed to English soon.
